<h1>Shift Logger Project</h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Project meant for CRUD operations on shift logs through a console UI to an API connected to an SQL Server</p>
<h3>Assigned requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This is an application where you should record a worker's shifts.</li>
  <li>You need to create two applications: the Web API and the UI that will call it.</li>
  <li>All validation and user input should happen in the UI app.</li>
  <li>Your API's controller should be lean. Any logic should be handled in a separate "service".</li>
  <li>You should use SQL Server, not SQLite</li>
  <li>You should use the "code first" approach to create your database, using Entity Framework's migrations tool.</li>
  <li>Your front-end project needs to have try-catch blocks around the API calls so it handles unexpected errors (i.e. the API isn't running or returns a 500 error.)</li>
</ul>
